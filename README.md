# Abstract

Or, "Yo dawg, I heard you like Chef!"

This talk is an exploration of how to build Chef Server 12 clusters with Chef Provisioning, including premium features like Chef Reporting and Chef Analytics. In this talk, I will cover several new capabilities and tools in the Chef ecosystem that makes it easier than ever before to build and manage scalable Chef Server clusters.

In this talk, attendees will learn:

* The basics of Chef Provisioning
* How Chef Provisioning works with EC2
* The chef-server-cluster cookbook
* How Chef's Policyfile feature is a great workflow for this use case
* How to use data to drive configuration of Chef Server clusters
* How the various premium features of Chef Server integrate across multiple nodes
